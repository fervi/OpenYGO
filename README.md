The purpose of the project is to create a free OpenYGO (of freedom) graphics, sounds, scripts, tools (...) for engine YGOPro to ultimately create a new game alternative for Yu-Gi-Oh!

In addition, the project aims to fix the game by restoring and creating new rules (create cards, etc.) That the game was balanced as much as possible.

Our version focuses on the generation of Yu-Gi-Oh DM and Yu-Gi-Oh GX (without fusion contact - Elemental HERO Neos).

The project is not focused on copying the cards from Yu-gi-oh, and the creation of entirely new (at most inspired by the original title).
