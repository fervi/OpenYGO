My suggestion is:

The minimum level of the monster is 1
The maximum level of the monster is 10

Each level guarantees a specific number of points awarded to the attack and defense - 700 points on level (which means that a monster with level 1 may be, for example. 200 points of attack, 500 defense).

If the monster has a positive effect (eg. Destroying one opponent's monster), it gets an extra level for it.

If the monster has a negative effect (ie. Can not attack the player directly or after attacking passes to the defense), the level is reduced by 1.

All levels are subjective and will be determined by adding new cards to databases.

One star (as mentioned) allow you to spend 700 points to statistics. Monster positive effect is treated as monster level 1 lower (ie the monster level 4 has 3 * 700 points = 2,100).

One level allows you to add up to 400 points of attack or defense 500 (ie, the monster level 1 can have 400 points of attack and defense 300, or 200 points of attack and 500 defense).

If there are questions, I recommend opening a new Issue.
